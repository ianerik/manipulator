GUI
---
1) Start-up
* Load previous configuration file.
* Move all manipulators to zero (X) (home) (= withdraw)
    - if zero has changed, redo calibration; save zero
* We might want to measure the course length of motors, with no pipette

2) Manipulator calibration (calibrate)
If not calibrated yet, or recalibrate button, or triggered calibration (fail):
* If not triggered by button, display dialog (ok/cancel)
* Move microscope to zero + 2 mm Z
* Withdraw pipette
* User: center pipette
* (Optional) Check whether microscope has moved
* Move along X slowly.
* Move microscope (guess), possibly assuming 30-45Â° angle
* Display status text: move the microscope/stage
* (Optional) Check whether pipette has moved (-> fail).
* Check whether microscope movement has same length.
* Repeat for Y and Z
* Calculate M and x0

3) Secondary calibration (change pipette)
If not calibrated or recalibrate button:
* Move microscope to zero
* Move pipette in (guess based on previous position)
* User: center pipette
* Calculate x0
* Check whether pipette is in axis, otherwise primary recalibration

4) Manipulator movement (GO)
* Check if calibrated; otherwise calibrate (dialog)

5) Manipulator withdrawal (WITHDRAW)
* Move home
* Status = not calibrated
