GUI

1) Start-up
* Load previous configuration file.

2) Primary calibration
All is saved to configuration file (pickle)

2a) Motor calibration
If not calibrated yet:
* Find out the starting points of the motors (ask user or automatic)
* Zero position of the microscope
If calibrated:
* Go to zeros
* Check whether zeros are actually reached, and no more movement is possible (-> recalibrate)

2b) Manipulator calibration
If not calibrated yet; or recalibrate button (or menu):
* Center pipette
* Check whether microscope has moved (but no big deal)
* (Optional) Indicate angle estimate. Used for initial guess.
* Move along X slowly, ask to follow with microscope.
* Check whether pipette has moved (-> fail).
* Check whether microscope movement has same length.
* Repeat for Y and Z
* Calculate M and x0

3) Secondary calibration
If not calibrated or recalibrate button:
* Move microscope to zero
* Move pipette in (guess based on previous position)
* User: center pipette
* Calculate x0
* Check whether pipette is in axis, otherwise primary recalibration

4) Manipulator movement (GO)
* Check if calibrated; otherwise calibrate (dialog)

5) Manipulator withdrawal (WITHDRAW)
* Move home
* Status = not calibrated
