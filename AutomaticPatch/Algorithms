AUTOCALIBRATION
---------------

Goal: control the manipulator by giving a position in the microscope referential

Theory:

The manipulator and the microscope are controlled by 3 motors each, along 3 axis forming a base
As the microscope is always controlled by the user, it is possible to control the manipulator using the following relation:

Mic = J*Man

Where Mic and Man are arrays of motors' position of the microscope and manipulator,
and J is a 3*3 Jacobian matrix expressing the position of the manipulator in the microscope referential.

For this relation to be usable for positionning, the origin of both the microscope and the manipulator should be such so
the tip of the pipette is in focus. Then, to move the tip to the desired microscope position i.e. find the Man array linked
to the desired Mic array, Man = J⁻¹*Mic should be computed.
